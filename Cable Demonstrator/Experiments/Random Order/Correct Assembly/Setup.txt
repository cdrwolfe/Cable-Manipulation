This set of experiments uses the vertical cable assembly test rig.

Order of assembly: Random i.e The order in which cables are manipulated changes between runs and can jump from one slot fixation for one cable to another

Error: No errors introduced, each cable is slotted into the fixtures in the correct sequence, however manipulation may jump between differant cables during this process
