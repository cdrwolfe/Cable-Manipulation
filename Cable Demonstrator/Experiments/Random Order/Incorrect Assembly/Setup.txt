This set of experiments uses the vertical cable assembly test rig.

Order of assembly: Random i.e The order in which cables are manipulated changes between runs and can jump from one slot fixation for one cable to another

Error: Cable fixture '2' of the blue cable is missed / ignored during assembly. All other cables are correctly processed, even if out of sequence.
